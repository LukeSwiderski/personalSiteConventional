      My Open Source Journey
    </h2>
    <p>
      Open source projects are a great way to gain real world experience. From setting up the development environment,
      learning a complex code base, to writing tests and figuring out merge conflicts, it necessitates all the skills
      required to work in a real world developement team. This is the reason I chose to endeavor in open source. I
      originally
      chose Firefox, because someone else I knew had some success writing patches. When I first looked at the
      documentation, I was pretty intimidated. There was a lot of terminology I wasn’t familiar with, and a lot of
      technical dependancies that were very foreign to me.<span id="dots">...</span>
    </p>
    <span id="more">
      <p>
        By closely following the docs, eventually I got the development environment up and running. Known bugs in the
        debugger software are posted
        publicly by Firefox. Just looking through the massive bug list and understanding what would be an appropriate
        choice for
        a
        beginner is a daunting task in itself. I decided to look for CSS bugs, because they might be simple, and might
        not
        require writing a test to go along with the patch. I made a list of possibly appropriate bugs and whittled it
        down
        from there.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first bug I worked on involved some lines of text overlapping each other in the debugger. I learned how to
        make small changes, build Nightly, which is the developer version of the Firefox browser, and then view my
        changes
        in a freshly built version. After much tinkering and making what looked like the correct changes to fix the
        problem, I was ready to
        submit my patch. I was quite afraid submitting my first patch. What if it is wrong, or what if it doesn’t submit
        properly? Is my commit message written correctly? I didn’t want to needlessly inconvenience the maintainers or
        look
        foolish. Fortunately,
        my
        patch went through, and after some minor back and forth with the maintainer, my patch was accepted and merged
        into
        the code base.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next I wanted to tackle a bug that involved javascript. Once again, I looked at the available bugs posted, made
        a
        list of possible candidates, and then ranked each bug by what would be the most simple. Unfortunately I errored
        in
        this estimation and spent about a month investigating a bug that was not skill appropriate for me. I was very
        comfortable with vanilla javascript at this time but not as familiar with React or Redux, which the debugger
        uses
        extensively. To diagnose bugs in the debugger, you basically run the debugger on the debugger. The debugger is
        written in javascript and uses React for components and Redux to control the flow of data. I spent some time
        learning about React and Redux and was able to learn a lot about the Firefox debugger code in the process, but a
        fix worthy of
        submitting continued to elude me. I asked questions in the bug thread, but I didn’t possess the knowledge yet to
        properly understand all of the answers.
      </p>
      <p>
        I decided to go back to my bug list and found a bug that a lot of other “students” like myself had attempted to
        solve but gave up when confronted with writing tests. The code change to fix the bug was simple and already
        posted, but to submit the patch, automated “mochitests” were required, which are basically asynchronous
        functions
        that mimic a user using the debugger as intended. When you run them, it fires up a browser and you can see the
        mouse movements and all the GUI actions a user might otherwise perform.
      </p>
      <p>
        I thought, “If I can figure out how to write these tests, I can submit this patch, and be prepared to write more
        tests in the future for bugs whose code changes I figure out myself.”
        Each debugger component has its own set of tests. I was able to locate them in the code base and read the
        existing tests for that component. Unfortunately, they were completely opaque to me. The syntax was familiar,
        but
        what was happening in each test was not apparent. I can see why so many others had given up at this point. I
        looked up the documentation for the mochitests. They describe what the tests do and are for, but the minutiae is
        not explained. I decided to look at every test in the debugger and make note of which were the shortest. From
        there I was able to make small code changes and see what they did. I broke a lot of tests. I added lots of
        debugger statements and paused tests that were in the process of running, so I could stop and look around the
        GUI
        and see what they were doing. I spent several weeks doing this. After many instances, I began noticing patterns.
        I
        began to see familiar snippets that had been used in other tests. I began to realize that there were shared
        functions that are used across many tests, and functions local to individual tests. I noticed the general way
        the browser
        is
        manipulated inside the tests.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started writing my own tests for my patch. I often would have to look up a similar test and borrow code for my
        own. At this point, I still didn’t always understand the correct context of everything, but I was able to run
        the
        tests, pause them with debugger statements, and see if the browser was doing what I wanted. Often it was not,
        and
        I would spend a whole day trying to figure out how to make it do one small task. The other difficult issue was
        having an assertion fail and then having to figure out why. Gradually my first mochitest appeared to be working
        and all my assertions were passing. Before submitting, I brainstormed all the edge cases I could think of. When
        I
        couldn’t come up with anymore, I submitted my patch. The reviewer said it looked good and asked for one
        additional
        assertion, which I added, and my patch was landed! I felt very empowered by this patch. I had a long way to go
        still, but I didn’t give up, and I figured out how to write the tests on my own.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next bug I tackled involved the breakpoints pane expanding unexpectedly when selecting a call stack frame.
        It
        should remain closed, if the user has collapsed it. By reading the code and stepping through it with the
        debugger,
        I was able to understand why this was happening. I came up with two solutions that would fix the problem. Having
        read so many other bugs, I realized there was a related bug. The breakpoints pane also expands unexpectedly when
        you
        click any of the “step” buttons. One solution made more sense to me than the other and would fix both bugs, so I
        decided to implement it. I realized that there were aspects of both React and Redux that I thought I understood,
        but really didn’t. I had to spend some time making simple React Redux apps to better understand the flow of
        information. Once I did this, I was able to implement the solution. Then it was time to write tests. Empowered
        by
        my last bug, I drove right in. I still had days where I spent hours trying to figure out a small problem, but
        once
        again I was able to write passing assertions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though this account is brief, I worked on this bug for several weeks. Sometimes the maintainers are too busy to
        review your patch right away when you post it. I had a good deal of back and forth on this one. I wrote a lot of
        tests. I learned a lot about Redux and how data moves through the ecosystem. Eventually the maintainers approved
        my work and my patch landed. This bug empowered me to go back to the bug I failed to fix earlier on. Having some
        experience now, I wasn’t as nervous to try different ideas. I ended up landing that patch and several others. I
        feel confident now to take on more difficult bugs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Open source has taught me that I can solve problems in a complex code base. I can work within a team that has a
        defined system and succeed. I can communicate effectively and apply feedback. I learned that everything might be
        hard at first, but through focus and persistence,
        I can figure things out!
